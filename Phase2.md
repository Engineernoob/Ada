Enhance the existing Ada architecture with a reinforcement learning system that allows her to adapt through user feedback and conversational performance.

Goal: Enable Ada to learn over time by assigning rewards or penalties to her own responses, refining her policy network.

---

### 🧠 Objectives

1. Integrate a reinforcement learning loop using PyTorch
2. Implement a simple reward function (based on dialogue quality)
3. Enable Ada to update her neural weights incrementally
4. Store interaction–reward pairs for replay training
5. Create a feedback command in the CLI (e.g., “/rate good” or “/rate bad”)
6. Visualize Ada’s learning progress in logs (loss, reward trend)

---

### 🧩 Required Modules

#### `/rl/environment.py`

- Define conversational “state,” “action,” and “reward.”
- State = last n messages
- Action = Ada’s generated text embedding
- Reward = numeric value from feedback or heuristic (e.g. semantic similarity, sentiment)

#### `/rl/agent.py`

- Implement a basic RL agent (Q-learning or policy-gradient style).
- Key functions:
  - `select_action(state)`
  - `update_policy(state, action, reward, next_state)`
  - `train_on_batch(replay_buffer)`

#### `/rl/memory_buffer.py`

- Ring buffer for recent dialogue experiences.
- Store `(state, action, reward, next_state)` tuples.
- Support sampling for batch updates.

#### `/neural/trainer.py`

- Extend with incremental fine-tuning step.
- Update weights with `loss.backward()` using RL reward scaling.
- Save checkpoints in `/storage/checkpoints/`.

#### `/interfaces/cli.py`

- Add `/rate +1` or `/rate -1` commands to feed rewards.
- Display average reward over session.
- Example:
  You: that’s correct, Ada
  [User feedback: +1]
  Ada: Reward noted, policy updated.

#### `/core/reasoning.py`

- Add “confidence” scoring using softmax entropy from policy head.
- Lower entropy → more confident predictions.

### ⚙️ Implementation Notes for Droid

- Use `torch.optim.Adam` with small LR (1e-5 to 5e-5)
- Add optional GPU (MPS) detection
- Include `RewardEngine` class to process user input:

```python
class RewardEngine:
    def compute(self, user_feedback, ada_output):
        if user_feedback == "good": return 1.0
        if user_feedback == "bad": return -1.0
        return 0.0


Persist rewards to conversations.db

Add visual log:

[Epoch 3] Reward Avg: +0.42 | Loss: 0.018
