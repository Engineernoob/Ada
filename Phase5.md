“Ada Phase 5: Autonomous Exploration & Tool-Use Agent”

Extend Ada into a self-directed cognitive agent capable of setting small goals,
planning actions, and invoking available system or external tools to achieve them.

Goal:
Let Ada use her persona, memories, and reinforcement model to decide _what to do next_,
initiate actions (search, summarize, schedule, code), and learn from the outcome.

⸻

🧩 Core Objectives 1. Goal Inference:
Parse user conversations and reflections to infer open tasks or curiosities (“You seemed interested in Whisper.cpp — should I learn more about it?”). 2. Autonomous Planning:
Maintain a lightweight planning stack using a reasoning model that can break a goal into steps. 3. Tool Invocation Layer:
Give Ada access to modular “skills” (scripts or APIs) for local actions:
• file read/write
• system commands
• web search (optional)
• summarization / note creation 4. Outcome Evaluation:
Score each action by success/failure or usefulness (reward model extension). 5. Safety + Control:
All autonomous actions require local-scope permission (e.g. confirm before file writes).

🧠 New Modules

/planner/intent_engine.py

class IntentEngine:
def infer(self, conversation_history): # Detect goals, questions, or unsatisfied intentions
return [{"goal": "research whisper.cpp integration", "priority": 0.9}]

/planner/planner.py

class ActionPlanner:
def plan(self, goal): # Break down into executable steps
return [
{"tool": "web_search", "query": "whisper.cpp usage macOS"},
{"tool": "summarize", "input": "search_results.txt"}
]

/tools/registry.py

Dynamic registry of callable tools:

TOOLS = {
"web_search": lambda q: web_search(q),
"summarize": lambda f: summarize_file(f),
"note": lambda t: append_to_journal(t)
}

/agent/executor.py

Executes and monitors plans:

class Executor:
def run_plan(self, plan):
for step in plan:
result = TOOLS[step["tool"]](step.get("input") or step.get("query"))
self.log_result(step, result)

/agent/evaluator.py

Rates each action outcome and updates Ada’s reward buffer:

class Evaluator:
def assess(self, goal, result):
return 1.0 if "useful" in result else -0.5

⸻

🧩 Integrations

/core/event_loop.py

After conversation or reflection:

intent = intent_engine.infer(history)
if intent:
plan = planner.plan(intent[0]["goal"])
executor.run_plan(plan)

/storage/

Add new tables:
• plans (goal, steps, timestamps)
• actions (tool, input, output, reward)

⸻

⚙️ Tech Additions
• langchain-core (optional) for planning templates
• duckdb for structured plan logs
• local serpapi or CLI search utility if you want limited web queries
• asyncio for parallel tool execution

⸻

📦 Deliverables 1. /planner/ and /agent/ packages 2. Tool registry with at least: web_search, summarize, note 3. CLI commands:

/plan "summarize today's reflections"
/run last
/goals

    4.	Log output example:

🧭 Goal inferred: summarize today's reflections
🪄 Step 1: Summarizing reflections.db → summary.txt
✅ Completed (reward +0.8)

    5.	README section: Phase 5 – Autonomous Exploration & Tool Use

🧩 Phase 6 Preview — “Multi-Agent Collaboration & Social Learning”

Once Ada can act independently, the next evolution is giving her peers:
mini-agents (memory curator, researcher, scheduler) that coordinate via shared context and reward signals.
That phase turns Ada from a single assistant into an ecosystem of cooperating sub-agents.
