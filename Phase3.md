Evolve Ada into a self-reflective conversational agent.
After each session or message exchange, Ada should evaluate her own conversational quality
and use that self-assessment to refine response generation, tone, and context recall.
üß© Objectives

Conversation-level reflection:
After every dialogue turn, Ada evaluates response quality (coherence, empathy, relevance).

Context-sensitive fine-tuning:
Use self-scores to adjust temperature, tone, and reinforcement weights dynamically.

Session summaries:
After each session, Ada writes a brief reflection log of what went well / what didn‚Äôt.

Incremental improvement:
Store past reflections to bias future conversations toward higher-scoring behaviors.

Autonomous adjustment:
No manual ‚Äúrate good / bad‚Äù required ‚Äî Ada learns from her own conversation analytics.

üß† New Components
/self_eval/conversation_metrics.py

Computes scores for each reply:

class ConversationMetrics:
def score(self, user_input, ada_output, history):
return {
"coherence": self.semantic_similarity(user_input, ada_output),
"tone": self.sentiment_alignment(user_input, ada_output),
"relevance": self.context_match(history, ada_output)
}

Implements:

cosine similarity (for coherence)

tone alignment via small sentiment classifier

keyword overlap for relevance

/self_eval/reflector.py

Produces reflection summaries & stores results:

class AdaReflector:
def summarize(self, dialogue_history):
metrics = ConversationMetrics()
scores = [metrics.score(*turn) for turn in dialogue_history]
avg = {k: sum(v[k] for v in scores)/len(scores) for k in scores[0]}
notes = self.generate_commentary(avg)
self.save_reflection(avg, notes)
return notes

/self_eval/adjuster.py

Applies updates:

if avg["coherence"] < 0.6: temperature -= 0.05
if avg["tone"] < 0.5: reward_scale += 0.1
if avg["relevance"] < 0.5: context_window += 2

üß© Integration
/core/event_loop.py

After each session:

from self_eval.reflector import AdaReflector
reflector = AdaReflector()
reflection = reflector.summarize(conversation_log)
print(f"[Reflection] {reflection}")

/storage/reflections.db

Schema:
| id | timestamp | avg_coherence | avg_tone | avg_relevance | lr | temp | summary |

‚öôÔ∏è Config Additions

/config/settings.yaml

self_eval:
enabled: true
reflect_after_messages: 10
min_score_for_update: 0.5
log_reflections: true

üì¶ Deliverables

self_eval/ package with conversation_metrics.py, reflector.py, and adjuster.py.

Integration into event_loop.py and trainer.py.

CLI command:

/reflect

Example output:

ü§î Reflection summary:
Coherence 0.82 | Tone 0.76 | Relevance 0.79
Ada: "I noticed I repeat greetings; will vary phrasing next time."
Adjusted temperature ‚Üí 0.93

reflections.db table to store logs.

Updated README: Phase 3 ‚Äì Conversational Self-Evaluation.

üß© Phase 4 Preview: Personality Consolidation

Use Ada‚Äôs reflection logs to identify stable conversational traits and build her meta-persona ‚Äî a memory-weighted average of tone, empathy, and phrasing that evolves over time.
